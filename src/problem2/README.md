# Assignment:

This is the swap form to calculate the equivalent amount of 2 tokens (pay & receive). This form calculate in both direction
I see there is no need to write unit test in this project since it take more times and there's no complex function to do that, except fetchTokens which I put in try/catch block and checked for null safety
