In this refactored version:

- Removed unnecessary destructuring of children.
- Corrected the filtering logic in the useMemo hook.
- Combined the mapping of formattedBalances and rows into a single map operation within the useMemo hook.
- Used a potentially unique key for the React elements (assuming currency can be unique).
- Commented the undefined classes.row, which should be defined or replaced as necessary.
